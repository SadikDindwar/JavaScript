//Numbers

// JavaScript considers both integers and flots as Number data type

console.log(typeof 90);
console.log(typeof 9.9);

//If number is added to a String then they will be concatinated and returned as String

let v1 = "12";
let v2 = 5;

let v3 = v1+v2;
console.log(v3);
console.log(typeof v3)
