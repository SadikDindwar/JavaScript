// Async / Await (V.Imp)

/*
Async/Await: is JavaScript syntax that lets us write asynchronous code in a clean, step-by-step and readable way.
It works on top of Promises, and behind the scenes it uses microtasks and the event loop to handle all the waiting.

Async: Async is a keyword that is used before the function to tell the function will return a Promise and that fnction may have Asynchronous code.

Await: Await is the keyword that is used inside the async function to pause the function execution until the promise gets resolved or rejected.
