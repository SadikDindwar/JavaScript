// Objects in JavaScript     //üß† üîπ ‚öôÔ∏è ‚ùó

/*
Object is the collection of key value pair where key(also know as properties) is String or symbols and value can be anny data type
like number,String,Boolean,Array, or even another Object.

*/


//Example Object

const employee={
    id: 10,
    name:"martin",
    age: 90,
    skills: ()=>{
        console.log("SkillA , SkillB, SkillC, SkillD");
    }
}
console.log(employee);

//Accessing Object Properties using "." dot notations

console.log(employee.id);
console.log(employee.name);
console.log(employee.age);
employee.skills();

//Accessing Object Properties using "[]" bracket  notations

console.log(employee["id"]);
console.log(employee["name"]);
console.log(employee["age"]);

/*
Use bracket notation when the property name:

has spaces ("first name")
starts with a number ("1key")
or is stored in a variable.
*/

//Adding new properties into Objects

employee.salary = 60000000;
console.log(employee);

//Deleting properties from Object

delete employee.age;
console.log(employee);


//Example Object 2

const client ={
    id:12,
    name:"josh",
    salary:80888797,
    language:()=>{
        return "speaks English";
    },
    skills:()=>{
        return "This person have many skills.";
    },
    height:function (){
        return this.name+" is 7 foot tall.";
    }
}
console.log(client);
console.log(client.language());

delete client.language;
console.log(client);

console.log(client.height());

üîπ Difference between Anonymous Function and Arrow Function

Anonymous Function:
1. Introduced in ES5.
2. Anonymous functions don‚Äôt have a name but use the 'function' keyword.
   They can be used as callbacks or assigned to variables.
3. Anonymous functions have their own 'this' context 
   (the value of 'this' depends on how the function is called).

Arrow Function:
1. Introduced in ES6.
2. Arrow functions don‚Äôt have a name and don‚Äôt use the 'function' keyword.
   They are often used as short and clean callback functions.
3. Arrow functions do NOT have their own 'this'.
   Instead, they inherit 'this' from the surrounding (lexical) scope.

// Very Important Notes related to Objects and Functions.
/*
üß† Objects:
üîπ objects are like containers which store related information in the form of key and value pairs.
‚öôÔ∏è example:
const car ={
    brand: "bmw",
    wheels: 4,
    cost:98765
}

üîπprototype: every object in js has its prototype, prototype is a another object which has shared properties.
 assume prototype as a parent so every object(child) has a prototype(parent object) and all the properties from prototype is inherited to the child obkect.
‚öôÔ∏è example:
sadik {
  name: "Sadik Dindwar"
}
   ‚¨Ü
   | (prototype link)
person {
  greet() { console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name); }
}
   ‚¨Ü
   | (prototype link)
Object.prototype
   ‚¨Ü
   |
null

üîπ why prototype?
You are Person. You have your own wallet (your properties).
But if you don‚Äôt have a pen, you borrow it from your father (prototype).
If he doesn‚Äôt have it, he asks your grandfather (prototype‚Äôs prototype).
That‚Äôs called the prototype chain.

üîπhow JS checks for properties ?
Does the object have the property?
If not, go to its prototype.
Keep going up until null.




üß†Object (with capital O).
üîπ Object(with capital O) is a builtin Constructer Function which is pressent globally and it helps in Creating Objects, copying objets , looking
   objects, getting Object keys and value.
   ‚öôÔ∏è example 1:
   const car = Object(); // same as {}
   car.name = "Audi";
   console.log(car); // { name: 'Audi' }
   
   ‚öôÔ∏è example 2:
    const animal ={
        kingdom:"animal",
    };

    const dog = Object.create(animal); // here dog object is created with animal object as its prototype.now dog has animal properties.
    dog.noOfLegs=2;  // we can also add extra props in dog
    
üîπ But Object is a Constructer function so how can a function call another funtion? ex : Object.create(animal).
    because in java script functions are also treated as a object and functions can also have its own properties and methods in it
    for example Object function has creat() method as property so it was able to call it.
    ‚öôÔ∏è example 1:
    greet(){
    console.log("hi");
    }
    greet.name="martin"; // here we are adding props to greet method
    greet.check = function(){  // here we are adding methods to the greet method.
       console.log("checked");
    }
    
    greet(); // op: hi
    greet.check(); // op : checked.
    console.log(greet.name); // op : martin.

üîπanother way of creating methods inside objects.
‚öôÔ∏è example :
    const person = {
        greet() {   
            console.log("Hello, shorthand method!");    // we can also declare methods inside objects like this this is shortne method introduced in ES6.
                                                        // here greet is treated as a key and greet() is treated as a value.
        }
    };
